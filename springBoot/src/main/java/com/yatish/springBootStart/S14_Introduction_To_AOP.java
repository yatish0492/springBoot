	/*
	 * AOP - Aspect Oriented Programming
	 * 
	 * NOTE: To know what is AOP, it is better to learn why AOP was introduced before, otherwise you won't understand this concept properly.
	 * 
	 * Why was AOP introduced?
	 * In Java, consider there are few lines of code which is required by all the classes(1000 classes) or maybe few number of classes. then the same code will be present in all those
	 * classes. So much of code duplication!!!!!!
	 * Solution - we can move that duplicate code to a seperate class and we can access that code by creating the object of it and accessing it.
	 * Solution not acceptable - still we need to write the object creation code and calling that function code in all the classes. hence still there is code duplication still present!!!
	 * Solution - I give up on java way. yes this where AOP was introduced by spring and it solves the issue.
	 * 
	 * How does AOP solve the code duplication issue, we mentioned in previous question?
	 * In AOP, it provides us with few more annotations like @Before etc annotations to solve this problem.
